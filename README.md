Trying to practice learning in numpy and pandas, so I'm trying to do an
experiment with data analysis from Twitter. Most of this code is directly
drawn from Rodolfo Ferro's at https://github.com/RodolfoFerro/pandas_twitter.

To run, you'll need an active Twitter app, which you can then use to fill the
variables in credentials.py. Then, in an Anaconda Jupyter Notebook with modules installed from the twit-analysis.py file header, you can run the code in a
notebook cell and the tables and graphs should display appropriately.
